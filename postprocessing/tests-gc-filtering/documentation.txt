This directory contains test traces to use with gc-filtering.py. A brief description for each trace follows:

cs.csv: the context switches trace

cpu_in_cs.csv: a trace CPU trace whose timestamps are all inside the time window of the context switches trace
cpu_mix_cs.csv: a trace CPU trace whose some timestamps are inside the time window of the context switches trace, some outside
cpu_out_cs.csv: a trace CPU trace whose timestamps are all outside the time window of the context switches trace

gc_in_cs.csv: a trace GC trace whose timestamps are all inside the time window of the context switches trace
gc_mix_cs.csv: a trace GC trace whose some timestamps are inside time window of the context switches trace, some outside
gc_out_cs.csv: a trace GC trace whose timestamps are all outside the time window of the context switches trace
