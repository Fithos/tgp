This directory contains test traces to use with aggregation.py. A brief description for each trace follows:

test_invalid_chain.csv: a chain of tasks spawning tasks, i.e., T1 -> T2 -> ... -> Tn, where there is no valid outer task. The output will be therefore the same as the input.
test_many_invalid_nested.csv: many of the nested tasks, having threads as outer tasks, do not comply with the rules for task aggregation. 
test_mix_outer.csv: in this file some tasks are nested, while others are not.
test_no_outer.csv: in this file there are no nested tasks. The output will be therefore the same as the input.
test_no_threads.csv: all tasks are not threads, therefore all outer tasks are valid by definition.
test_seven_centre.csv: task with ID 7 is the task from which almost all outer tasks spawn from, either directly or indirectly. It is therefore expected that task with ID 7 will have a large aggregated granularity.
test_valid_chain.csv: a chain of tasks spawning tasks, i.e., T1 -> T2 -> ... -> Tn, where all outer tasks are valid. This means that the output will be formed by just one big aggregated task.
test_valid_threads.csv: all tasks are threads and all their nested tasks are valid nested tasks, thus making all outer tasks valid.

Note: notation 'Ti -> Tj' means that task 'Ti' has spawned task 'Tj'.
